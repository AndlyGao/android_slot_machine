## Fruit Machine

Goal: Create a fruit machine in Android.

Last week, for your homework you were asked to create a fruit machine using objects modelled in Java. You are now being asked to take that Java code and use it as the basis for an Android app which simulates the same fruit machine.

### MVP
The aim is to display the results of the Java logic already written. For example, if the user spins and lands 3 matching symbols a winning message is displayed and their winnings updated and stored. Users should also be allowed to nudge and hold at random times.

### Project Extensions

* Display the symbols above and below as well to help with nudges
* Allow users to choose from Symbol Packs (Different games.)
* Extend to 5 reels
* Improve the UI


## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.
